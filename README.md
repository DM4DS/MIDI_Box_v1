# MIDI_Box_v1

First: I´m no professional with GITHUB.
If you have questions: write me an email: dm4ds@gmx.de and give me some days to answer. I don´t do daily emails. Thanks.
German prefered but english is also fine.

I had to compress (ZIP) some files while GITHUB has a 25MByte Limit for files.
Please unZIP them after download . no password set.

If you look for the PINout? Look into the sketch, all PINs are commented.
So just build it and connect everything like described in the sketch.
You are allowed to modify the sketch for your needs, but you have to name me as original author: DM4DS - Sandor. 
NO commercial usage of my files, code, design, intellectual property, not even parts of them without my OK or
you accept automatic an invoice of one thousand euro for each sold one in favor of the German RED Cross.
But back to the fun part of this project. :) !

My most Arduino UNOs have the big USB , like printers , then the case named UNO is the correct one.
Most Leonardos do have the small Mikro USB, or if you have an UNO with it, use the LEONARDO case.
The position of the plug and of course the size is different so I had to design two cases.
Some Color impressions how it can look if you print it in black / red or blue:

If you wonder "WTH" is that big screw on the BOTTOM  case section :)
It is for a M27 NUT! It´s to give the whole thing more weight.
The design is done the way that you first mount the NUT and THEN the Arduino.
The Arduino will block the NUT to get loosen. The thread is designed to get close, at the right nut angle that everything fits.
Here how it looks like:

In the next picture you see the HEAVY VFO Button - it´s designed to get a more weightend feeling on the VFO.
The standard is fine but some OMs asked me for a heavy version, they like the feeling, so I did a heavy version.
Try the one you prefer. Also the "other Button".

Now you have seen some impressions from the project. It´s fun operating with it.
No longer switching from logbook back to the radio software etc.
PTT everytime, everywhere, withouit searching the mouse :)


Enjoy building it. If you send me pictures, I can upload them to share here or you upload them @☻thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4799798


Thanks for your feedback and interest in my projects.

PS: I´m still working on the big one with DDS for CW and Roger beep / Quindar tones but I need 2 things:
- positive feedback
- - time :) but it will come!
