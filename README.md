# MIDI_Box_v1

First: I´m no professional with GITHUB.
If you have questions: write me an email: dm4ds@gmx.de and give me some days to answer. Thanks.
German prefered but english is also fine.

I had to compress some files while GITHUB has a 25MByte Limit for files.
Please unZIP them after download . no password set.

If you look for the PINout? Look into the sketch, all PINs are commented.
So just build it and connect everything like described in the sketch.
You are allowed to modify the sketch for your needs, but you have to name me as "DM4DS - Sandor"

My most Arduino UNOs have the big USB , like printers , then the case named UNO is the correct one.
Most Leonardos do have the small Mikro USB, or if you have an UNO with it, use the LEONARDO case.
The position of the plug and of course the size is different so I had to modify the case.
Some Color impressions how it can look if you print it in black / red or blue:

If you wonder "WTH" is that big screw on the BOTTOM  case section :)
It is for a M27 NUT! It´s to give the Bottom more weight.
The design is done the way that you first mount the NUT and THEN the Arduino. Why?
You will see but I can tell you. The Arduino will block the NUT to get loosen. The thread
is designed to get close at the right nut angle that everything fits. Here how it looks like:

In the next picture you see the HEAVY VFO Button - it´s designed to get a more weightend feeling on the VFO.
The standard is fine but some OMs asked me for a heavy version, they like the feeling, so I done.
Try the one you prefer. Also the "other Button".

Thanks for your interest in my projects.


 Enjoy building it and thanks for your positive feedback

PS: I´m still working on the big one with DDS for CW and Roger beep / Quindar tones but I need 2 things:
- positive feedback
- - time :) but it will come!
