# MIDI_Box_v1

First: I´m no professional with GITHUB.
If you have questions: write me an email: dm4ds@gmx.de and give me some days to answer. Thanks.
German prefered but english is also fine.

I had to compress some files while GITHUB has a 25MByte Limit for files.
Please unZIP them after download . no password set.

If you look into the sketch, all PINs are commented.
So just build it and connect everything like descibed in the sketch.
You are allowed to modify the sketch, but you have to name me as "DM4DS - Sandor"

My most Arduino UNOs have the big USB , like printers , then the case named UNO is the correct one.
Most Leonardos do have the small Mikro USB, or if you have an UNO with it, use the LEONARDO case.
The position of the plug and of course the size is different so I had to modify the case.

If you wonder WTH is that big screw on the BOTTOM :)
It is for a M27 NUT! It´s to give the Bottom more weight.
The design is done the way that you first mount the NUT and THEN the Arduino. Why?
You will see but I can tell you. The Arduino will block the NUT to get loosen. The thread
is designed to get close at the right nut angle that everything fits.
A picture is in the "code"

 Enjoy building it and thanks for you positive feedback
